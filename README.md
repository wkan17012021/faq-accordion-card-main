## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

Copy and try to understand Vanzasetia's code. Even copying the code (i have used min.css), the desktop-illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg does not show. Happy for now to close the book on this one and move on.

### Built with

Vanzasetia magic.

### What I learned

I learned that attempting to decipher someone elses code is not an effective learning method for me. I spent about an hour and a half to two hours on this (initial deliberation about how to tackle this challenge, procrastinating about what resources i need to attempt this and what styles and properties were involved). Finally, i was convinced that i didn't want to spend many hours trying to get this to work so i went for a different method: copy someone else more skilled and learn how they did it. For me, the rendering of the responsive images, overlay and positioning was more complicated and i still do not understand how that's done. The accordion principle i think i have a high level overview how it works with JS: click event listener - set styling height: 0 or display: none in combination with a foreach() to iterate through all FAQs and only open the FAQ that was clicked.

### Continued development

Use bootstrap, materialize css etc. for an out-of-the-box accordion solution.

### Useful resources

There were a few youtube accordion videos consulted on this but could not find one that matched this challenge example. Even the videos with people attempting this challenge, i didn't feel were explained in great detail. There weren't many- which is a hint.
